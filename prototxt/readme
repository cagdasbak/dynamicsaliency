Network Architectures
SSNet : The baseline single stream saliency networks. Utilizes only spatial (appearance) information and accepts still video frames.
TSNet : Exploits only temporal information whose input is given in the form of optical flow images. 
STSMaxNet : Performs fusion by using element-wise max fusion.
STSConvNet : Employs convolutional fusion after the fifth convolution layers.
